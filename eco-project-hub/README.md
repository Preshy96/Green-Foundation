# Conservation Smart Contract

## Overview
This smart contract facilitates the creation, funding, and management of conservation projects on the Stacks blockchain. It enables transparent tracking of environmental initiatives, milestone management, and community participation through voting and funding mechanisms.

## Features

### Project Management
- Create and manage conservation projects across multiple categories
- Track project milestones and completion status
- Monitor environmental impact metrics
- Manage project funding and stakeholder participation

### Supported Conservation Categories
- Wildlife conservation
- Forest preservation
- Marine ecosystem protection
- Climate action initiatives
- Biodiversity protection

### Key Functionalities

#### Project Creation and Management
- Initialize new conservation projects with detailed specifications
- Set funding goals and project timelines
- Track project status and approval states
- Monitor accumulated funds and project progress

#### Milestone Tracking
- Create and manage project milestones
- Verify milestone completion with proof submission
- Track milestone deadlines and completion status
- Associate validators with specific milestones

#### Voting System
- Stake tokens to participate in project voting
- Track voter participation and decisions
- Enforce voting period constraints
- Prevent duplicate voting

#### Environmental Impact Metrics
- Track number of trees planted
- Monitor protected area in square meters
- Record carbon offset in tons
- Count protected species
- Measure community benefit score
